This project is a simple bash script that allows you to easily change the sample rate of audio that pipewire handles.
Useful for making the most out of your audio hardware or making sure your audio is not up or down sampled for playback when working on audio projects
Pipewire's default is 48khz. To get started just download the .sh file and run it. *NOTE* this effect does not persist after reboot.
